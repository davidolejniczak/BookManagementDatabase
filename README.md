## Design decisions or challenges
During development, I chose Flask as the web framework for its simplicity, which is ideal for a project like this. SQLite was selected as the database because itâ€™s serverless, and easy to integrate with Flask, making it the perfect choice for this project. One challenge I faced was ensuring efficient database connections and properly handling validation, especially for the ISBN field. It took me a while to find a way but I used regular expressions to ensure only valid formats were accepted. For the front-end, I decided to use Bootstrap as it provides a clean, responsive design with minimal custom CSS. This really helped me as I do not have deep knowledge in front-end devoplement.
